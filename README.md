POKER GAMES

Poker is a family of card games involving betting and individual play, 
whereby the winner is determined by the ranks and combinations of their cards, 
some of which remain hidden until the end of the game. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, 
the number of shared or "community" cards and the number of cards that remain hidden.

>>In casual play, the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked 
by a token called a dealer button (or buck). In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, 
but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal
dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table, one at a time.
